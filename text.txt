Capital Strategy & Rally Instructions
I believe the best strategy to secure victory is to only allow T5 (Tier 5) members to join Shrimp's rally against the Capital.
How the Rally Works:
Your troops are commanded by Shrimp's hero. Therefore, even if you join using Formation 3 or 4, as long as you send T5 troops, the rally will achieve maximum strength (Highest HP x ATK x DEF).
Important Note: R4s cannot kick members from an R5 or R4 rally. Therefore, Shrimp must handle this himself and ensure everyone is informed.
Member Assignments:
Crab, Iron, Doctor Strange, Killer Shrimp, Komeko, One Piece, and Sittingbull will focus on Shrimp's rally and the four Outer Towers.
Instructions for T5 Members:
Formation 2: Join Shrimp's rally.
Formations 3 & 4: Must be deployed to the center of the Capital, ready to reinforce immediately when the Capital runs out of troops.
Formation 1: Focus on the four Outer Towers. Capture or garrison them depending on the battle situation.
Specific Instructions for Suzu:
Suzu must initiate a rally first. Only T4 or lower troops should join Suzu's rally.
Critical Reminders:
Rally Lock: Once you join a rally against the Capital or a Tower, you cannot create or join another rally against that same target. Please exercise caution.
Contingency Plan: If the situation deteriorates, Crab and Suzu will launch rallies against the Capital first to clear out enemy troops. Shrimp will follow up with a rally immediately after.
Garrison Management: I will continuously kick lower-tier troops from the Capital to ensure it remains filled with T5 troops.
Forbidden Actions:
Members are strictly forbidden from joining Shrimp's rally (unless it is an emergency, in which case T4 may join).
All T4 and T3 members: Your first priority is Suzu's rally. Alternatively, join Crab's rally on the Capital or other T5 rallies against the Outer Towers.
Deployment Note:
Shrimp will use Formation 2 for towers or joining rallies, while Formations 3 and 4 must be stationed near the Capital for reinforcements when troops are depleted.
Server-Wide Rule Change:
The new Capital event rules do not award points for open-field troop combat (Kill Event). Do not waste troops fighting outside. Focus strictly on the Capital or the Towers if the enemy occupies them.
